Opening scene: You slowly open your eyes. You don't recognize anything around
you and you can't remember anything.

RPG 1:

Npc_1: Who are you and how did you find this place? Outsiders are not allowed to
go any further than this point.

Npc_2: We felt a sudden surge of evil energy from the dragons tomb yesterday.
This place is not safe for you, leave now.

Npc_3: We serve to guard the tomb of the dragon. It was sealed away 1000 years
ago.

RPG 2:

Npc_4: Why are you here? The ants should have stopped you. Only ants, spiders,
and ladybugs are allowed near the tomb. Turn back now.

Npc_5: I'm not well versed in the art of alchemy... But something feels wrong
about you. Where do you come from and why are you here?

Npc_6 The dragon is a powerfull creature that destroyed half of the worlds
population. It is now locked away in a tomb, guarded by a giant beetle. There is
no reason for you to go beyond this point.

RPG 3:

Npc_7: I feel an evil presence from you. I feel the same when I visit the
dragons tomb. I knew the dragon summoned something... but he couldn't have
summoned you... right?

Npc_8: You've come far enough. The dragon is too dangerous to release, why will
you not listen to us? Any further and we will have to use alchemy in order to
stop you.

Npc_9: Us ladybugs have learned from the mistake of summoning the dragon. That
burdon is now all of ours to bear. You've been warned enough, we will not hold
back.
